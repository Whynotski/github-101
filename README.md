To Push Code is a 3 Step Process

0. Modify the code
1. Add the changes to the stage
2. Commit the stage to be pushed
3. Push the code to the remote repository

Relevant Commands

- `git add .` to add all files in repository to the stage
- `git commit -m "commit msg"` to commit previously added files to be pushed
- `git push` to send commited files to the remote/web repository on GitHub.com
